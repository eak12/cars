# Find Percentage of Rating of Car Regarding Safety 

## 1.0 Introduction

I found the data sources from:

- https://www.kaggle.com/elikplim/car-evaluation-data-set

- https://data.world/uci/car-evaluation

I address two in my analysis:

- Does there exist a high percentage of cars that cost high, medium and low values that rate as high, medium regarding safety?
- Considering high, medium and low cost value of cars, what percentage of 2, 3, 4 seat cars rate high, medium and low concerning safety?

## 2.0 Synopsis


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
